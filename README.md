## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements basic **Stack** and **Queue** data structures  
using a generic **Doubly Linked List** in C++.  

It demonstrates core linked list operations and how they support  
stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) behaviors.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 Generic Doubly Linked List with insert, delete, and search  
- 🛎️ Queue based on the doubly linked list  
- 📚 Stack using the doubly linked list  
- 🖥️ Simple console demo showing stack operations

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

- Compile all source files together  
- Run the executable  
- View the output of stack operations in the console

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- ⚙️ Improve the Doubly Linked List (planned, need rest before continuing)  
- 🛡️ Add exception handling and boundary checks  
- ➕ Extend Stack and Queue interfaces (`clear()`, `size()`, `isEmpty()`)  
- 🔄 Implement copy constructors and assignment operators
