## Project Overview

This project implements basic **Stack** and **Queue** data structures using a generic **Doubly Linked List** in C++. It demonstrates core linked list operations and how they support stack and queue behaviors.

---

## Features

- Generic Doubly Linked List with insert, delete, and search  
- Queue (FIFO) based on the doubly linked list  
- Stack (LIFO) using the doubly linked list  
- Simple console demo showing stack operations

---

## How to Use

- Compile all source files together  
- Run the executable  
- See the stack operation output in the console

---

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the Doubly Linked List (planned, but need time and rest before working on it)  
- Add exception handling and boundary checks  
- Extend Stack and Queue interfaces (e.g., `clear()`, `size()`, `isEmpty()`)  
- Implement copy constructors and assignment operators
